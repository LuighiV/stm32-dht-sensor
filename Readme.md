# STM32 DHT sensor library

This is a library adapted from:
[Adafruit DHT library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)


This library enable the use of HAL libraries from STM32Cube, 
and trough them recreates the behaviour required to communicate with the DHT sensor.

Probed with STM32 Nucleo-H745 and DHT21 sensor.
